## Architecture Decisions

- Cloud Provider: AWS
- Infrastructure Provisioning: Terraform (Infrastructure as Code)
- Application Platform: Managed Kubernetes (Amazon EKS)
- Application Type: Containerized microservices
- Database: Kubernetes-managed services (with DBaaS discussed as an alternative)

This architecture was chosen to demonstrate cloud-native principles,
scalability, automation, and industry best practices.
